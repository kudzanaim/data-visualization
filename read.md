# Description
This application uses UI components that leverage the API server hosted [here](https://work-gcsusetqgq-uk.a.run.app/poi). I have implemented the following features:
- A client-side general chart visualizations in the form of a bar chart
- A functional data table that is used to browse through data supplied from the API. This table allows for fuzzy search on meaningful values (such as POI names).
- A functional map-based data visualization based on different POI-bound metrics.

# Tools & Technology Used
- React and redux for managing state and API queries.
- Google Charts npm package for building robust charts.
- D3js for builsing the map visualizations, and mapping the API metrics to the map.
- Firebase for hosting the web application.
